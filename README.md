# to-do

to-do is a browser based to do list. I often write my to do lists on pieces of paper that I end up losing, so this project was also a way to create a to do app that I could keep open in my conputer tabs to remind me to update to dos.

This to do list app was made using React JS and HTML. This was my first time using a Javascript framework 


I relied heavily on Google searching and online tutorials, as well as a lot of trial and error to figure out how to code this bookmark organizer. I followed chxshi's tutorial to learn how to deploy the frontend and backend. The biggest challenge of this project (other than trying to deploy it - my repo structure was very wrong...) was figuring out how to create folders to store the bookmarks.
