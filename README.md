# to-do

to-do is a browser based to do list. I often write my to do lists on pieces of paper that I end up losing, so this project was also a way to create a to do app that I could keep open in my conputer tabs to remind me to update to dos.

This to do list app was made using React JS, HTML and CSS. This was my first time using a Javascript framework, and I used many online resources, like W3Schools and Medium to figure out how to use it. I learned how to create and start apps with React, as well as how to code with it. I also followed some to do list app tutorials to get an idea of what my to do list app would need. The biggest challenge I had was figuring out how to allow editing the to do list items, as well as styling the app, since I had to reorganize all the buttons and text fields that I grouped together weirdly.
